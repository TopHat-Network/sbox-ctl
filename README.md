# Combat Training Live

## What is it

Combat Training Live, CTL for short, is a rebirth of a Garry's Mod gamemode I created for funsies during COVID-19 lockdown.
The gamemode was never complete, had a lot of dodgy code and wasn't properly thought out - it was just a way to kill time.

The premise of CTL is to create something new from the same principle idea of OvO - fast pace, basic combat, fun and unique skills.

## The original gamemode, OvO

The original gamemode was based off of something me and a friend would often do. We'd load up COD, start a private match and just shoot each other while talking - we'd do this for honest to god hours. Sometimes we'd mix it up and set rules on what weapons we could use, or come up with fun little mini-games. Ultimately, it was one versus one in a non-competitive environment, _just having fun_.

## The rebirth

CTL will be something similar - fast paced combat, quick time-to-kill, some unique skills here and there, and most importantly; The ability to customise to fight to how you like.
Originally, we were going to live to the name as well, One verus One, however while we might include that option we're most likely not going to limit the gamemode to just that.

However, if you do decide to go one on one, then that's where the LIVE aspect of Combat Training Live comes into play - Spectators are welcome to join the match and watch from the sidelines, unique camera angles and free-cam spectator modes. _We will also be taking a look at the possibilty of streaming matches outside the game, but for now we have no idea if that's possible..._

## Open-Source
We intend to make CTL as open-source as possible, hence why this repo exists and why it's public. Obviously, as we develop the maps, materials, music, models, etc some content may become restricted - but our code and everything you'd need to run and make your own version _will_ be available.

Why? Our development team has two projects currently planned for S&Box. We [have already made OvO public knowledge](https://forum.facepunch.com/t/ovo-the-one-versus-one-gamemode-for-when-mw2-rust-just-aint-gonna-cut-it/245099) and given that we want it to be as customisable as possible, we felt making it open-source would be the best way to achieve that in addition to providing as many options in-game as possible.

I, WhiskeeDev, am currently looking to bring people into my development team. I can't offer you anything, and I'm not looking for people to dedicate themself to myself or TopHat - I'm just looking for people I can work with and get along with - who knows maybe we'll end up being good friends.
